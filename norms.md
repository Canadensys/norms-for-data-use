# Norms for Data Use and publication

This document describes the [VertNet](http://www.vertnet.org) norms for data publication and use. This is NOT a legal document or contract. This IS a well-considered and oft discussed code of conduct that the members of the VertNet community are expected to uphold when they publish datasets to VertNet or utilize the data within the network in any way. When you adopt these norms, you will both model a much needed set of ethical behaviors and help us to build a vibrant community intended to support current and future efforts to make biodiversity data as complete, discoverable, and accessible as possible.

VertNet wishes to acknowledge the [Canadensys](http://www.canadensys.net/) for it's efforts to develop [the norms](http://www.canadensys.net/about/norms) upon which this document is based.

## What We Believe

* Biodiversity data should be as complete, discoverable, and accessible as possible via portals, public URLs, and other means.
* Biodiversity data should be standardized so it can be aggregated, shared, and used as easily as possible.
* Factual data (see, [What Can be Protected by Copyright and Licensing](http://www.vertnet.org/resources/datalicensingguide.html#protected) in the VertNet Guide to Copyright and Licenses for Dataset Publication) cannot be protected by copyright and should be committed to the Public Domain.
* Any licenses used to protect compilations or datasets (when applicable) should be licensed using standardized, machine readable licenses, such as licenses from the Creative Commons. Ideally, we would like to see all datasets using the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) waiver.
* Data publishers have the right to protect any creative content, including, but not limited to images, sound files, videos, and descriptive/speculative text, where applicable.
* This process should be as simple as possible for both data publishers and for users (results may vary from collection to collection).
* All data publishers should get the credit they deserve when the data they curate are used by others for broader benefit.
* It is worth the time and effort to achieve these goals to the greatest extent possible.

# The Norms

## Give Credit Where Credit is Due

As is common practice in scientific research, cite the data you are using. VertNet data publishers have invested an extensive amount of time, resources, and effort into collecting, digitizing, maintaining, and publishing the biodiversity information you are using. They deserve credit for their work. We have provide the [preferred formats for citation](#citations) at the end of this document.

## Be Responsible

Use the data responsibly. Data are published to VertNet and other biodiversity portals to allow you and everyone else to better study and understand the world in which we live. It is your responsibility to use these data for the benefit of our collective health, knowledge, and self improvement. Avoid using these data in any way that is unlawful, harmful, or misleading. Please understand that these data are subject to change, error, and sampling bias. When Giving Credit Where Credit is Due, protect the reputation of the data publisher and indicate any changes you may have made to the data clearly.

## Share Knowledge

Let VertNet know if — and how — you have used data from the network. It helps:
* VertNet to understand value of this project to you and the community and to create better tools and services for your use.
* data publishers to showcase their efforts and encourages them to continue to improve data quality and maintenance of collections.
* you and your work reach a wider audience through an expanded presence (yes, we publicize and celebrate the work that people do with VertNet data).
* everyone - data publishers, bioinformatics projects, and researchers to raise the money needed to keep the the data, products, services, and research alive.

You can [contact us](http://www.vertnet.org/feedback/contact.html) or share your work via with any member of the [VertNet team](http://www.vertnet.org/about/team.html) directly.

Communicate with the data publisher(s) directly. Let them know if you have comments or questions, notice errors, or want more information about the data they publish. We've provided you with three ways to start a conversation:
* post an issue directly from the VertNet data portal. It's simple and we've posted instructions on our [our blog](http://blog.vertnet.org/post/74297660841/issue-tracking-available-in-the-vertnet-portal-at).
* contact the data publisher directly using the contact information provided within each dataset published through VertNet via the [Publishers page](http://portal.vertnet.org/publishers) on the VertNet portal.
* use the [feedback form](http://www.vertnet.org/feedback/contact.html) provided at the top of every VertNet web page.

## Respect the Data License

Understand and respect the data licence or waiver under which the data are published. It is indicated in the *[rights](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#dcterms:rights)* field of every record and in the dataset metadata. To help you [make greater use of the data](http://www.canadensys.net/2012/why-we-should-publish-our-data-under-cc0), most of our participants have dedicated their data to the [public domain (CC0)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Do not remove the public domain mark or provide misleading information about the copyright status.

## Data publication conditions

We care about data and we just want to make sure you do too. In order to [publish your data](http://www.vertnet.org/join/join.html) through VertNet, you should meet the following criteria:

* You are associated with a Canadian collection or organization.
* You are publishing a specimen or observation dataset.
* You hold the rights to publish the data.
* You are willing to maintain the dataset and improve its quality where possible.
* You are willing to provide sufficient metadata, so users can learn what the dataset is about.
* You are publishing the data under an open license, so others can really use them. We strongly recommend publishing under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) ([here is why](http://www.canadensys.net/2012/why-we-should-publish-our-data-under-cc0)).

### Where can I find the elements to create a citation?

All the elements can be found in the [Darwin Core](http://www.canadensys.net/darwin-core) fields for each record you download:

* [data publisher]: in [institutionCode](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#institutionCode) (and [rightsHolder](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#rightsHolder)). This is also the institution that has registered the dataset with [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org).

* [dataset name]: in [datasetName](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#datasetName). This is also the title of the dataset in its metadata and on its repository page.

* [link to dataset]: in [datasetID](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#datasetID). This link redirects to the human readable repository page of the dataset.

* [record id]: in [catalogNumber](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#catalogNumber). If no catalogNumber is available, use [occurrenceID](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#occurrenceID).

*These norms may be subject to minor revisions without notice; major revisions will be announced. The norms are based on those of the [Europeana Foundation](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/pd-usage-guide.html) and [Open Data Commons](http://opendatacommons.org/norms/odc-by-sa/).*
